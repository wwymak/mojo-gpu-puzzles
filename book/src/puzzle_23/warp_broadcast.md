# `warp.broadcast()` One-to-Many Communication

For warp-level coordination we can use `broadcast()` to share data from one lane to all other lanes within a warp. This powerful primitive enables efficient block-level computations, conditional logic coordination, and one-to-many communication patterns without shared memory or explicit synchronization.

**Key insight:** _The [broadcast()](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/warp/broadcast) operation leverages SIMT execution to let one lane (typically lane 0) share its computed value with all other lanes in the same warp, enabling efficient coordination patterns and collective decision-making._

> **What are broadcast operations?** Broadcast operations are communication patterns where one thread computes a value and shares it with all other threads in a group. This is essential for coordination tasks like computing block-level statistics, making collective decisions, or sharing configuration parameters across all threads in a warp.

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll master:
- **Warp-level broadcasting** with `broadcast()`
- **One-to-many communication** patterns
- **Collective computation** strategies
- **Conditional coordination** across lanes
- **Combined broadcast-shuffle** operations

The `broadcast` operation enables one lane (by default lane 0) to share its value with all other lanes:
\\[\\Large \text{broadcast}(\text{value}) = \text{value_from_lane_0_to_all_lanes}\\]

This transforms complex coordination patterns into simple warp-level operations, enabling efficient collective computations without explicit synchronization.

## The broadcast concept

Traditional coordination requires complex shared memory patterns:

```mojo
# Traditional approach - complex and error-prone
shared_memory[lane] = local_computation()
sync_threads()  # Expensive synchronization
if lane == 0:
    result = compute_from_shared_memory()
sync_threads()  # Another expensive synchronization
final_result = shared_memory[0]  # All threads read
```

**Problems with traditional approach:**
- **Memory overhead**: Requires shared memory allocation
- **Synchronization**: Multiple expensive barrier operations
- **Complex logic**: Managing shared memory indices and access patterns
- **Error-prone**: Easy to introduce race conditions

With `broadcast()`, coordination becomes elegant:

```mojo
# Warp broadcast approach - simple and safe
collective_value = 0
if lane == 0:
    collective_value = compute_block_statistic()
collective_value = broadcast(collective_value)  # Share with all lanes
result = use_collective_value(collective_value)
```

**Benefits of broadcast:**
- **Zero memory overhead**: No shared memory required
- **Automatic synchronization**: SIMT execution guarantees correctness
- **Simple pattern**: One lane computes, all lanes receive
- **Composable**: Easy to combine with other warp operations

## 1. Basic broadcast

Implement a basic broadcast pattern where lane 0 computes a block-level statistic and shares it with all lanes.

**Requirements:**
- Lane 0 should compute the sum of the first 4 elements in the current block
- This computed value must be shared with all other lanes in the warp using `broadcast()`
- Each lane should then add this shared value to its own input element

**Test data:** Input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...]` should produce output `[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, ...]`

**Challenge:** How do you coordinate so that only one lane does the block-level computation, but all lanes can use the result in their individual operations?


### Configuration

- Vector size: `SIZE = WARP_SIZE` (32 or 64 depending on GPU)
- Grid configuration: `(1, 1)` blocks per grid
- Block configuration: `(WARP_SIZE, 1)` threads per block
- Data type: `DType.float32`
- Layout: `Layout.row_major(SIZE)` (1D row-major)

### 1. **Understanding broadcast mechanics**

The `broadcast(value)` operation takes the value from lane 0 and distributes it to all lanes in the warp.

**Key insight:** Only lane 0's value matters for the broadcast. Other lanes' values are ignored, but all lanes receive lane 0's value.

**Visualization:**
```
Before broadcast: Lane 0 has \(\text{val}_0\), Lane 1 has \(\text{val}_1\), Lane 2 has \(\text{val}_2\), ...
After broadcast:  Lane 0 has \(\text{val}_0\), Lane 1 has \(\text{val}_0\), Lane 2 has \(\text{val}_0\), ...
```

**Think about:** How can you ensure only lane 0 computes the value you want to broadcast?

### 2. **Lane-specific computation**

Design your algorithm so that lane 0 performs the special computation while other lanes wait.

**Pattern to consider:**
```
var shared_value = initial_value
if lane == 0:
    # Only lane 0 computes
    shared_value = special_computation()
# All lanes participate in broadcast
shared_value = broadcast(shared_value)
```

**Critical questions:**
- What should other lanes' values be before the broadcast?
- How do you ensure lane 0 has the correct value to broadcast?

### 3. **Collective usage**

After broadcasting, all lanes have the same value and can use it in their individual computations.

**Think about:** How does each lane combine the broadcast value with its own local data?

```

<div class="solution-explanation">

This solution demonstrates the fundamental broadcast pattern for warp-level coordination.

**Algorithm breakdown:**
```mojo
if global_i < size:
    # Step 1: Lane 0 computes special value
    var broadcast_value: output.element_type = 0.0
    if lane == 0:
        # Only lane 0 performs this computation
        block_start = block_idx.x * block_dim.x
        var sum: output.element_type = 0.0
        for i in range(4):
            if block_start + i < size:
                sum += input[block_start + i]
        broadcast_value = sum

    # Step 2: Share lane 0's value with all lanes
    broadcast_value = broadcast(broadcast_value)

    # Step 3: All lanes use the broadcast value
    output[global_i] = broadcast_value + input[global_i]
```

**SIMT execution trace:**
```
Cycle 1: Lane-specific computation
  Lane 0: Computes sum of input[0] + input[1] + input[2] + input[3] = 1+2+3+4 = 10
  Lane 1: broadcast_value remains 0.0 (not lane 0)
  Lane 2: broadcast_value remains 0.0 (not lane 0)
  ...
  Lane 31: broadcast_value remains 0.0 (not lane 0)

Cycle 2: broadcast(broadcast_value) executes
  Lane 0: Keeps its value → broadcast_value = 10.0
  Lane 1: Receives lane 0's value → broadcast_value = 10.0
  Lane 2: Receives lane 0's value → broadcast_value = 10.0
  ...
  Lane 31: Receives lane 0's value → broadcast_value = 10.0

Cycle 3: Individual computation with broadcast value
  Lane 0: output[0] = 10.0 + input[0] = 10.0 + 1.0 = 11.0
  Lane 1: output[1] = 10.0 + input[1] = 10.0 + 2.0 = 12.0
  Lane 2: output[2] = 10.0 + input[2] = 10.0 + 3.0 = 13.0
  ...
  Lane 31: output[31] = 10.0 + input[31] = 10.0 + 32.0 = 42.0
```

**Why broadcast is superior:**
1. **Coordination efficiency**: Single operation coordinates all lanes
2. **Memory efficiency**: No shared memory allocation required
3. **Synchronization-free**: SIMT execution handles coordination automatically
4. **Scalable pattern**: Works identically regardless of warp size

**Performance characteristics:**
- **Latency**: 1 cycle for broadcast operation
- **Bandwidth**: 0 bytes (register-to-register communication)
- **Coordination**: All 32 lanes synchronized automatically

## 2. Conditional broadcast

Implement conditional coordination where lane 0 analyzes block data and makes a decision that affects all lanes.

**Requirements:**
- Lane 0 should analyze the first 8 elements in the current block and find their maximum value
- This maximum value must be broadcast to all other lanes using `broadcast()`
- Each lane should then apply conditional logic: if their element is above half the maximum, double it; otherwise, halve it

**Test data:** Input `[3, 1, 7, 2, 9, 4, 6, 8, ...]` (repeating pattern) should produce output `[1.5, 0.5, 14.0, 1.0, 18.0, 2.0, 12.0, 16.0, ...]`

**Challenge:** How do you coordinate block-level analysis with element-wise conditional transformations across all lanes?

### Configuration

- Vector size: `SIZE = WARP_SIZE` (32 or 64 depending on GPU)
- Grid configuration: `(1, 1)` blocks per grid
- Block configuration: `(WARP_SIZE, 1)` threads per block

<details>
<summary><strong>Tips</strong></summary>

<div class="solution-tips">

### 1. **Analysis and decision-making**

Lane 0 needs to analyze multiple data points and make a decision that will guide all other lanes.

**Key questions:**
- How can lane 0 efficiently analyze multiple elements?
- What kind of decision should be broadcast to coordinate lane behavior?
- How do you handle boundary conditions when analyzing data?

**Pattern to consider:**
```
var decision = default_value
if lane == 0:
    # Analyze block-local data
    decision = analyze_and_decide()
decision = broadcast(decision)
```

### 2. **Conditional execution coordination**

After receiving the broadcast decision, all lanes need to apply different logic based on the decision.

**Think about:**
- How do lanes use the broadcast value to make local decisions?
- What operations should be applied in each conditional branch?
- How do you ensure consistent behavior across all lanes?

**Conditional pattern:**
```
if (local_data meets_broadcast_criteria):
    # Apply one transformation
else:
    # Apply different transformation
```

### 3. **Data analysis strategies**

Consider efficient ways for lane 0 to analyze multiple data points.

**Approaches to consider:**
- Finding maximum/minimum values
- Computing averages or sums
- Detecting patterns or thresholds
- Making binary decisions based on data characteristics

```

**Decision-making execution trace:**
```
Input data: [3.0, 1.0, 7.0, 2.0, 9.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, ...]

Step 1: Lane 0 finds maximum of first 8 elements
  Lane 0 analysis:
    Start with input[0] = 3.0
    Compare with input[1] = 1.0 → keep 3.0
    Compare with input[2] = 7.0 → update to 7.0
    Compare with input[3] = 2.0 → keep 7.0
    Compare with input[4] = 9.0 → update to 9.0
    Compare with input[5] = 4.0 → keep 9.0
    Compare with input[6] = 6.0 → keep 9.0
    Compare with input[7] = 8.0 → keep 9.0
    Final decision_value = 9.0

Step 2: Broadcast decision_value = 9.0 to all lanes
  All lanes now have: decision_value = 9.0, threshold = 4.5

Step 3: Conditional execution per lane
  Lane 0: input[0] = 3.0 < 4.5 → output[0] = 3.0 / 2.0 = 1.5
  Lane 1: input[1] = 1.0 < 4.5 → output[1] = 1.0 / 2.0 = 0.5
  Lane 2: input[2] = 7.0 ≥ 4.5 → output[2] = 7.0 * 2.0 = 14.0
  Lane 3: input[3] = 2.0 < 4.5 → output[3] = 2.0 / 2.0 = 1.0
  Lane 4: input[4] = 9.0 ≥ 4.5 → output[4] = 9.0 * 2.0 = 18.0
  Lane 5: input[5] = 4.0 < 4.5 → output[5] = 4.0 / 2.0 = 2.0
  Lane 6: input[6] = 6.0 ≥ 4.5 → output[6] = 6.0 * 2.0 = 12.0
  Lane 7: input[7] = 8.0 ≥ 4.5 → output[7] = 8.0 * 2.0 = 16.0
  ...pattern repeats for remaining lanes
```

**Mathematical foundation:** This implements a threshold-based transformation:
\\[\\Large f(x) = \\begin{cases}
2x & \\text{if } x \\geq \\tau \\\\
\\frac{x}{2} & \\text{if } x < \\tau
\\end{cases}\\]

Where \\(\\tau = \\frac{\\max(\\text{block\_data})}{2}\\) is the broadcast threshold.

**Coordination pattern benefits:**
1. **Centralized analysis**: One lane analyzes, all lanes benefit
2. **Consistent decisions**: All lanes use the same threshold
3. **Adaptive behavior**: Threshold adapts to block-local data characteristics
4. **Efficient coordination**: Single broadcast coordinates complex conditional logic

**Applications:**
- **Adaptive algorithms**: Adjusting parameters based on local data characteristics
- **Quality control**: Applying different processing based on data quality metrics
- **Load balancing**: Distributing work based on block-local complexity analysis

## 3. Broadcast-shuffle coordination

Implement advanced coordination combining both `broadcast()` and `shuffle_down()` operations.

**Requirements:**
- Lane 0 should compute the average of the first 4 elements in the block and broadcast this scaling factor to all lanes
- Each lane should use `shuffle_down(offset=1)` to get their next neighbor's value
- For most lanes: multiply the scaling factor by `(current_value + next_neighbor_value)`
- For the last lane in the warp: multiply the scaling factor by just `current_value` (no valid neighbor)

**Test data:** Input follows pattern `[2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, ...]` (first 4 elements: 2,4,6,8 then repeating 1,3,5,7)
- Lane 0 computes scaling factor: `(2+4+6+8)/4 = 5.0`
- Expected output: `[30.0, 50.0, 70.0, 45.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 40.0, ...]`

**Challenge:** How do you coordinate multiple warp primitives so that one lane's computation affects all lanes, while each lane also accesses its neighbor's data?

### Configuration

- Vector size: `SIZE = WARP_SIZE` (32 or 64 depending on GPU)
- Grid configuration: `(1, 1)` blocks per grid
- Block configuration: `(WARP_SIZE, 1)` threads per block

### 1. **Multi-primitive coordination**

This puzzle requires orchestrating both broadcast and shuffle operations in sequence.

**Think about the flow:**
1. One lane computes a value for the entire warp
2. This value is broadcast to all lanes
3. Each lane uses shuffle to access neighbor data
4. The broadcast value influences how neighbor data is processed

**Coordination pattern:**
```
# Phase 1: Broadcast coordination
var shared_param = compute_if_lane_0()
shared_param = broadcast(shared_param)

# Phase 2: Shuffle neighbor access
current_val = input[global_i]
neighbor_val = shuffle_down(current_val, offset)

# Phase 3: Combined computation
result = combine(current_val, neighbor_val, shared_param)
```

### 2. **Parameter computation strategy**

Consider what kind of block-level parameter would be useful for scaling neighbor operations.

**Questions to explore:**
- What statistic should lane 0 compute from the block data?
- How should this parameter influence the neighbor-based computation?
- What happens at warp boundaries when shuffle operations are involved?

### 3. **Combined operation design**

Think about how to meaningfully combine broadcast parameters with shuffle-based neighbor access.

**Pattern considerations:**
- Should the broadcast parameter scale the inputs, outputs, or computation?
- How do you handle boundary cases where shuffle returns undefined data?
- What's the most efficient order of operations?

2. **Horizontal coordination** (shuffle): Lane i → Lane i+1
3. **Combined computation**: Uses both broadcast and shuffle data

**Mathematical foundation:**
\\[\\Large \\text{output}[i] = \\begin{cases}
(\\text{input}[i] + \\text{input}[i+1]) \\cdot \\beta & \\text{if lane } i < \\text{WARP\_SIZE} - 1 \\\\
\\text{input}[i] \\cdot \\beta & \\text{if lane } i = \\text{WARP\_SIZE} - 1
\\end{cases}\\]

Where \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k=0}^{3} \\text{input}[\\text{block\_start} + k]\\) is the broadcast scaling factor.

**Advanced coordination benefits:**
1. **Multi-level communication**: Combines global (broadcast) and local (shuffle) coordination
2. **Adaptive scaling**: Block-level parameters influence neighbor operations
3. **Efficient composition**: Two primitives work together seamlessly
4. **Complex algorithms**: Enables sophisticated parallel algorithms

**Real-world applications:**
- **Adaptive filtering**: Block-level noise estimation with neighbor-based filtering
- **Dynamic load balancing**: Global work distribution with local coordination
- **Multi-scale processing**: Global parameters controlling local stencil operations

## Summary

Here is what the core pattern of this section looks like

```mojo
var shared_value = initial_value
if lane == 0:
    shared_value = compute_block_statistic()
shared_value = broadcast(shared_value)
result = use_shared_value(shared_value, local_data)
```

**Key benefits:**
- **One-to-many coordination**: Single lane computes, all lanes benefit
- **Zero synchronization overhead**: SIMT execution handles coordination
- **Composable patterns**: Easily combines with shuffle and other warp operations

**Applications**: Block statistics, collective decisions, parameter sharing, adaptive algorithms.
