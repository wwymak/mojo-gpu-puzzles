## Overview

GPU synchronization is the foundation that enables complex parallel algorithms to work correctly and efficiently. This chapter explores three fundamental synchronization patterns that appear throughout high-performance GPU computing: **pipeline coordination**, **memory barrier management**, and **streaming computation**.

**Core learning objectives:**
- **Understand when and why** different synchronization primitives are needed
- **Design multi-stage algorithms** with proper thread specialization
- **Implement iterative patterns** that require precise memory coordination
- **Optimize synchronization overhead** while maintaining correctness guarantees

**Architectural progression:** These puzzles follow a carefully designed progression from basic pipeline coordination to advanced memory barrier management, culminating in streaming computation patterns used in high-throughput applications.

## Key concepts

**Thread coordination paradigms:**
- **Simple parallelism**: All threads execute identical operations (previous puzzles)
- **Specialized parallelism**: Different thread groups execute distinct algorithms (this chapter)
- **Pipeline parallelism**: Sequential stages with producer-consumer relationships
- **Iterative parallelism**: Multiple passes with careful buffer management

**Synchronization primitive hierarchy:**
- **Basic [`barrier()`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/sync/#barrier)**: Simple thread synchronization within blocks
- **Advanced [mbarrier APIs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/sync/)**: Fine-grained memory barrier control with state tracking
- **Streaming coordination**: Asynchronous copy and bulk transfer synchronization

**Memory consistency models:**
- **Shared memory coordination**: Fast on-chip memory for inter-thread communication
- **Global memory ordering**: Ensuring visibility of writes across different memory spaces
- **Buffer management**: Double-buffering and ping-pong patterns for iterative algorithms

## Configuration

**System architecture:**
- **Block size**: `TPB = 256` threads per block for optimal occupancy
- **Grid configuration**: Multiple blocks processing different data tiles
- **Memory hierarchy**: Strategic use of shared memory, registers, and global memory
- **Data types**: `DType.float32` for numerical computations

**Synchronization patterns covered:**
1. **Multi-stage pipelines**: Thread specialization with barrier coordination
2. **Double-buffered iterations**: Memory barrier management for iterative algorithms
3. **Streaming computation**: Asynchronous copy coordination for high-throughput processing

**Performance considerations:**
- **Synchronization overhead**: Understanding the cost of different barrier types
- **Memory bandwidth**: Optimizing access patterns for maximum throughput
- **Thread utilization**: Balancing specialized roles with overall efficiency

## Puzzle structure

This chapter contains three interconnected puzzles that build upon each other:

### **[Multi-Stage Pipeline Coordination](barrier.md)**

**Focus**: Thread specialization and pipeline architecture

Learn how to design GPU kernels where different thread groups execute completely different algorithms within the same block. This puzzle introduces **producer-consumer relationships** and strategic barrier placement for coordinating between different algorithmic stages.

**Key concepts**:
- Thread role specialization (Stage 1: load, Stage 2: process, Stage 3: output)
- Producer-consumer data flow between processing stages
- Strategic barrier placement between different algorithms

**Real-world applications**: Image processing pipelines, multi-stage scientific computations, neural network layer coordination

### **[Double-Buffered Stencil Computation](memory_barrier.md)**

**Focus**: Advanced memory barrier APIs and iterative processing

Explore **fine-grained synchronization control** using [mbarrier APIs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/sync/) for iterative algorithms that require precise memory coordination. This puzzle demonstrates double-buffering patterns essential for iterative solvers and simulation algorithms.

**Key concepts**:
- Advanced [mbarrier APIs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/sync/) vs basic [`barrier()`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/sync/#barrier)
- Double-buffering with alternating read/write buffer roles
- Iterative algorithm coordination with explicit memory barriers

**Real-world applications**: Iterative solvers (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel), cellular automata, simulation time-stepping
