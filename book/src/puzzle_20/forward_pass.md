# ⚛️ Fused vs Unfused Kernels

## Overview

In this puzzle, we explore the performance benefits of kernel fusion by implementing and comparing two approaches to the [LayerNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) and Linear operation:

1. **Unfused approach**: Executes LayerNorm and Linear as separate operations
2. **Fused kernel**: Combines LayerNorm and Linear operations into a single GPU kernel

This comparison demonstrates how kernel fusion can significantly improve performance by:
- Reducing memory bandwidth usage
- Minimizing kernel launch overhead
- Improving cache utilization
- Eliminating intermediate memory allocations

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll master:
- **Kernel fusion techniques** for combining multiple operations
- **Memory bandwidth optimization** through fused operations
- **Performance benchmarking** of different kernel implementations
- **Numerical stability** in fused operations
- **PyTorch custom operation integration**

The mathematical operations we're fusing are:

1. LayerNorm:
\\[\Large \text{LayerNorm}(x) = \gamma \odot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta \\]

2. Linear:
\\[\Large \text{Linear}(x) = Wx + b \\]

When fused, we compute:
\\[\Large \text{Fused}(x) = W(\gamma \odot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta) + b \\]

## Understanding LayerNorm

LayerNorm is a normalization technique that helps stabilize and accelerate the training of deep neural networks. Let's break down its components and parameters:

### What LayerNorm does

1. **Normalization**: LayerNorm normalizes the activations across the features (hidden dimensions) for each sample independently. This means:
   - For each sequence position, it computes statistics across the hidden dimension
   - Each sample in the batch is normalized independently
   - This is different from [BatchNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167), which normalizes across the batch dimension

2. **Parameters**:
   - \\(\gamma\\) (scale): A learnable parameter vector that allows the network to learn the optimal scale for each feature
   - \\(\beta\\) (shift): A learnable parameter vector that allows the network to learn the optimal shift for each feature
   - \\(\epsilon\\): A small constant (1e-5) added to the variance to prevent division by zero

### What LayerNorm does in practice

LayerNorm performs several crucial functions in deep neural networks:

1. **Feature standardization**:
   - Transforms each feature to have zero mean and unit variance
   - Makes the network's learning process more stable
   - Helps prevent the "internal covariate shift" problem where the distribution of layer inputs changes during training

2. **Gradient flow**:
   - Improves gradient flow through the network
   - Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients
   - Makes training more efficient by allowing higher learning rates

3. **Regularization effect**:
   - Acts as a form of implicit regularization
   - Helps prevent overfitting by normalizing the feature distributions
   - Makes the network more robust to input variations

4. **Sequence modeling**:
   - Particularly effective in transformer architectures
   - Helps maintain consistent signal magnitude across different sequence lengths
   - Enables better handling of variable-length sequences

5. **Training dynamics**:
   - Accelerates training convergence
   - Reduces the need for careful learning rate tuning
   - Makes the network less sensitive to weight initialization

### Mathematical components

1. **Mean Calculation** (\\(\mu\\)):
   \\[\Large \mu = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{i=1}^{H} x_i \\]
   - Computes the mean across the hidden dimension (H)
   - Each sequence position has its own mean

2. **Variance Calculation** (\\(\sigma^2\\)):
   \\[\Large \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{i=1}^{H} (x_i - \mu)^2 \\]
   - Computes the variance across the hidden dimension
   - Used to scale the normalized values

3. **Normalization and Scaling**:
   \\[\Large \text{LayerNorm}(x) = \gamma \odot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta \\]
   - First normalizes the input to have zero mean and unit variance
   - Then applies learnable scale (\\(\gamma\\)) and shift (\\(\beta\\)) parameters
   - The \\(\odot\\) symbol represents elementwise multiplication (Hadamard product)
   - For example, if \\(\gamma = [1.2, 0.8, 1.5]\\)  and normalized input is \\([0.5, -0.3, 0.7]\\), then \\(\gamma \odot x = [0.6, -0.24, 1.05]\\)

### Why LayerNorm is important

1. **Training Stability**:
   - Prevents activations from growing too large or small
   - Helps maintain consistent signal magnitude throughout the network

2. **Feature Learning**:
   - The scale (\\(\gamma\\)) and shift (\\(\beta\\)) parameters allow the network to learn which features are important
   - Can effectively learn to ignore or emphasize certain features

3. **Independence**:
   - Unlike BatchNorm, LayerNorm's statistics are computed independently for each sample
   - Makes it more suitable for variable-length sequences and small batch sizes

## Configuration

- Batch size: `BATCH_SIZE = 4`
- Sequence length: `SEQ_LEN = 4`
- Hidden dimension: `HIDDEN_DIM = 8`
- Output dimension: `OUTPUT_DIM = 16`
- Epsilon: `EPS = 1e-5`
- Data type: `DType.float32`

## Implementation approaches

### 1. Unfused implementation

The unfused approach executes operations separately using multiple kernels. Here are some of the kernels we wrote in the previous chapters:

#### Matrix multiplication kernel
From [Puzzle 14](../puzzle_14/puzzle_14.md), we reuse the tiled matrix multiplication kernel for the linear transformation:

```mojo
{{#include ../../../problems/p20/op/layernorm_linear.mojo:matmul_idiomatic_tiled}}
```

#### Transpose kernel
For efficient memory access patterns, we use a transpose kernel with shared memory tiling:

```mojo
{{#include ../../../problems/p20/op/layernorm_linear.mojo:transpose_kernel}}
```

#### Bias addition kernel
A simple elementwise addition kernel for adding the bias term:

```mojo
{{#include ../../../problems/p20/op/layernorm_linear.mojo:add_bias_kernel}}
```

#### LayerNorm kernel

Now complete this kernel to implement the LayerNorm operation. You'll need to:
1. Compute mean \\(\mu\\) and variance \\(\sigma^2\\) for each sequence position
2. Normalize the input using these statistics
3. Apply the scale \\(\gamma\\) and shift \\(\beta\\) parameters

```mojo
{{#include ../../../problems/p20/op/layernorm_linear.mojo:layernorm_kernel}}
```

**Implementation steps:**
1. First, compute mean and variance using parallel reduction
2. Then normalize the input using these statistics
3. Finally, apply the scale and shift parameters

**Characteristics of unfused approach:**
- Multiple kernel launches (LayerNorm → MatMul → Bias)
- Intermediate tensor allocations between operations
- More memory bandwidth usage due to separate passes
- Simpler implementation with clear separation of concerns
- Easier to debug as each operation is isolated

<div class="solution-tips">

1. **Thread organization**:
   - Use one thread block per sequence position (grid: `[batch_size, seq_len]`)
   - Each thread handles one hidden dimension element

   - Access input tensor with `[batch_idx, seq_idx, hidden_idx]`
   - Access output tensor with `[batch_idx, seq_idx, hidden_idx]`
   - Access LayerNorm parameters with `[hidden_idx]`

3. **Numerical stability**:
   - Add epsilon (1e-5) before taking square root
   - Use `rebind[Scalar[dtype]]` for proper type casting
   - Compute variance as (sq_sum / hidden_dim) - (mean * mean)

4. **Performance**:
   - Compute mean and variance in a single pass
   - Reuse computed statistics for all elements in sequence
   - Avoid unnecessary memory barriers

{{#include ../../../solutions/p20/op/layernorm_linear.mojo:layernorm_kernel_solution}}
```

<div class="solution-explanation">

The unfused implementation follows a straightforward approach where each thread handles one element of the output tensor. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Thread and Block Organization**:
   ```mojo
   batch_idx = block_idx.x
   seq_idx = block_idx.y
   hidden_idx = thread_idx.x
   ```
   - Each thread block handles one sequence position in the batch
   - Grid dimensions: `[batch_size, seq_len]`
   - Each thread processes one element in the hidden dimension
   - Early return if indices are out of bounds:
     ```mojo
     if (batch_idx >= batch_size or seq_idx >= seq_len or hidden_idx >= hidden_dim):
         return
     ```

2. **Statistics Computation**:
   ```mojo
   var sum_val: Scalar[dtype] = 0
   var sq_sum: Scalar[dtype] = 0

   @parameter
   for h in range(hidden_dim):
       val = input[batch_idx, seq_idx, h]
       sum_val += rebind[Scalar[dtype]](val)
       sq_sum += rebind[Scalar[dtype]](val * val)
   ```
   - Compute sum and squared sum in a single pass
   - Use `@parameter` for compile-time loop unrolling
   - Proper type casting with `rebind[Scalar[dtype]]`
   - Calculate mean and variance:
     ```mojo
     mean_val = sum_val / hidden_dim
     var_val = (sq_sum / hidden_dim) - (mean_val * mean_val)
     inv_std = 1.0 / sqrt(var_val + 1e-5)
     ```

3. **Normalization and Scaling**:
   ```mojo
   input_val = input[batch_idx, seq_idx, hidden_idx]
   normalized = (input_val - mean_val) * inv_std * rebind[Scalar[dtype]](
       ln_weight[hidden_idx]
   ) + rebind[Scalar[dtype]](ln_bias[hidden_idx])
   output[batch_idx, seq_idx, hidden_idx] = normalized
   ```
   - Apply normalization: \\[\Large \text{normalized} = \gamma \odot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta \\]
   - Scale with learnable parameter `γ` (ln_weight)
   - Add learnable bias `β` (ln_bias)
   - Store result in output tensor

4. **Performance Characteristics**:
   - Each thread computes statistics independently
   - No shared memory usage (simple but less efficient)
   - Memory access pattern:
     - Input: `[batch_idx, seq_idx, h]`
     - Output: `[batch_idx, seq_idx, hidden_idx]`
     - Parameters: `[hidden_idx]`
   - Numerical stability ensured by:
     - Adding epsilon (1e-5) before square root
     - Using proper type casting
     - Computing variance in a numerically stable way

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Type Safety**:
     - Use `Scalar[dtype]` for intermediate calculations
     - `rebind[Scalar[dtype]]` for proper type casting
     - Ensures consistent floating-point precision

   - **Memory Access**:
     - Coalesced reads from input tensor
     - Coalesced writes to output tensor
     - Sequential access to LayerNorm parameters

   - **Computation Flow**:
     - Statistics computation: \\[\Large O(H) \text{ operations per thread} \\]
     - Normalization: \\[\Large O(1) \text{ operations per thread} \\]
     - Total complexity: \\[\Large O(H) \text{ per output element} \\]

   - **Limitations**:
     - Redundant computation of statistics
     - No shared memory for intermediate results
     - High memory bandwidth usage
     - Multiple kernel launches required

This implementation is correct but not optimal for performance, as shown in the benchmark results where it's slightly slower than the CPU version. The fused implementation will address these performance limitations by:
- Computing statistics once per sequence
- Reusing normalized values
- Reducing memory traffic
- Eliminating intermediate tensor allocations

### 2. Fused kernel implementation

{{#include ../../../problems/p20/op/layernorm_linear.mojo:minimal_fused_forward_kernel}}
```

**Key optimizations:**
- Single kernel launch instead of two
