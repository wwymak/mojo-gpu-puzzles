# Complete Version

Implement a kernel that computes a prefix-sum over 1D LayoutTensor `a` and stores it in 1D LayoutTensor `output`.

**Note:** _If the size of `a` is greater than the block size, we need to synchronize across multiple blocks to get the correct result._

## Configuration

- Array size: `SIZE_2 = 15` elements
- Threads per block: `TPB = 8`
- Number of blocks: 2
- Shared memory: `TPB` elements per block

Notes:

- **Multiple blocks**: When the input array is larger than one block, we need a multi-phase approach
- **Block-level sync**: Within a block, use `barrier()` to synchronize threads
- **Host-level sync**: Between blocks, use `ctx.synchronize()` at the host level
- **Auxiliary storage**: Use extra space to store block sums for cross-block communication

## Code to complete

You need to complete two separate kernel functions for the multi-block prefix sum:

1. **First kernel** (`prefix_sum_local_phase`): Computes local prefix sums within each block and stores block sums
2. **Second kernel** (`prefix_sum_block_sum_phase`): Adds previous block sums to elements in subsequent blocks

The main function will handle the necessary host-side synchronization between these kernels.

The key to this puzzle is understanding that [barrier](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/sync/barrier/) only synchronizes threads within a block, not across blocks. For cross-block synchronization, you need to use host-level synchronization:

<div class="solution-tips">

### 1. Build on the simple prefix sum

The [Simple Version](./simple.md) shows how to implement a single-block prefix sum. You'll need to extend that approach to work across multiple blocks:

```
Simple version (single block): [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] → [0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28]

Complete version (two blocks):
Block 0: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] → [0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28]
Block 1: [8,9,10,11,12,13,14] → [8,17,27,38,50,63,77]
```

But how do we handle the second block's values? They need to include sums from the first block!

### 2. Two-phase approach

The simple prefix sum can't synchronize across blocks, so split the work:

1. **First phase**: Each block computes its own local prefix sum (just like the simple version)
2. **Second phase**: Blocks incorporate the sums from previous blocks

Remember: `barrier()` only synchronizes threads within one block. You need host-level synchronization between phases.

### 3. Extended memory strategy

Since blocks can't directly communicate, you need somewhere to store block sums:

- Allocate extra memory at the end of your output buffer
- Last thread in each block stores its final sum in this extra space
- Subsequent blocks can read these sums and add them to their elements

### 4. Key implementation insights

- **Different layouts**: Input and output may have different shapes
- **Boundary handling**: Always check `global_i < size` for array bounds
- **Thread role specialization**: Only specific threads (e.g., last thread) should store block sums
- **Two kernel synchronization**: Use `ctx.synchronize()` between kernel launches

### 5. Debugging Strategy

If you encounter issues, try visualizing the intermediate state after the first phase:
```
After first phase: [0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28, 8,17,27,38,50,63,77, ???,???]
```

Where `???` should contain your block sums that will be used in the second phase.

### Running the code

To test your solution, run the following command in your terminal:

<div class="code-tabs" data-tab-group="package-manager">
  <div class="tab-buttons">
    <button class="tab-button">uv</button>

```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

<div class="solution-explanation">

This solution implements a multi-block prefix sum using a two-kernel approach to handle an array that spans multiple thread blocks. Let's break down each aspect in detail:

## The challenge of cross-block communication

The fundamental limitation in GPU programming is that threads can only synchronize within a block using `barrier()`. When data spans multiple blocks, we face the challenge: **How do we ensure blocks can communicate their partial results to other blocks?**

### Memory layout visualization

For our test case with `SIZE_2 = 15` and `TPB = 8`:

```
Input array:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

Block 0 processes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Block 1 processes: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] (7 valid elements)
```

We extend the output buffer to include space for block sums:

```
Extended buffer: [data values (15 elements)] + [block sums (2 elements)]
                 [0...14] + [block0_sum, block1_sum]
```

The size of this extended buffer is: `EXTENDED_SIZE = SIZE_2 + num_blocks = 15 + 2 = 17`

## Phase 1 kernel: Local prefix sums

### Race Condition Prevention in Local Phase

The local phase uses the same explicit synchronization pattern as the simple version to prevent read-write hazards:
- **Read Phase**: All threads first read the values they need into a local variable `current_val`
- **Synchronization**: `barrier()` ensures all reads complete before any writes begin
- **Write Phase**: All threads then safely write their computed values back to shared memory

This prevents race conditions that could occur when multiple threads simultaneously access the same shared memory locations during the parallel reduction.

### Step-by-step execution for Block 0

1. **Load values into shared memory**:
   ```
   shared = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```

2. **Iterations of parallel reduction** (\\(\log_2(TPB) = 3\\) iterations):

   **Iteration 1** (offset=1):

   **Read Phase**: Each active thread reads the value it needs:
   ```
   T₁ reads shared[0] = 0    T₅ reads shared[4] = 4
   T₂ reads shared[1] = 1    T₆ reads shared[5] = 5
   T₃ reads shared[2] = 2    T₇ reads shared[6] = 6
   T₄ reads shared[3] = 3
   ```

   **Synchronization**: `barrier()` ensures all reads complete

   **Write Phase**: Each thread adds its read value:
   ```
   shared[0] = 0              (unchanged)
   shared[1] = 1 + 0 = 1
   shared[2] = 2 + 1 = 3
   shared[3] = 3 + 2 = 5
   shared[4] = 4 + 3 = 7
   shared[5] = 5 + 4 = 9
   shared[6] = 6 + 5 = 11
   shared[7] = 7 + 6 = 13
   ```
   After barrier: `shared = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]`

   **Iteration 2** (offset=2):

   **Read Phase**: Each active thread reads the value it needs:
   ```
   T₂ reads shared[0] = 0    T₅ reads shared[3] = 5
   T₃ reads shared[1] = 1    T₆ reads shared[4] = 7
   T₄ reads shared[2] = 3    T₇ reads shared[5] = 9
   ```

   **Synchronization**: `barrier()` ensures all reads complete

   **Write Phase**: Each thread adds its read value:
   ```
   shared[0] = 0              (unchanged)
   shared[1] = 1              (unchanged)
   shared[2] = 3 + 0 = 3      (unchanged)
   shared[3] = 5 + 1 = 6
   shared[4] = 7 + 3 = 10
   shared[5] = 9 + 5 = 14
   shared[6] = 11 + 7 = 18
   shared[7] = 13 + 9 = 22
   ```
   After barrier: `shared = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22]`

   **Iteration 3** (offset=4):

   **Read Phase**: Each active thread reads the value it needs:
   ```
   T₄ reads shared[0] = 0    T₆ reads shared[2] = 3
   T₅ reads shared[1] = 1    T₇ reads shared[3] = 6
   ```

   **Synchronization**: `barrier()` ensures all reads complete

   **Write Phase**: Each thread adds its read value:
   ```
   shared[0] = 0              (unchanged)
   shared[1] = 1              (unchanged)
   shared[2] = 3              (unchanged)
   shared[3] = 6              (unchanged)
   shared[4] = 10 + 0 = 10    (unchanged)
   shared[5] = 14 + 1 = 15
   shared[6] = 18 + 3 = 21
   shared[7] = 22 + 6 = 28
   ```
   After barrier: `shared = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]`

3. **Write local results back to global memory**:
   ```
   output[0...7] = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
   ```

4. **Store block sum in auxiliary space** (only last thread):
   ```
   output[15] = 28  // at position size + block_idx.x = 15 + 0
   ```

### Step-by-step execution for Block 1

1. **Load values into shared memory**:
   ```
   shared = [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, uninitialized]
   ```
   Note: Thread 7 doesn't load anything since `global_i = 15 >= SIZE_2`, leaving `shared[7]` uninitialized. This is safe because Thread 7 won't participate in the final output.

2. **Iterations of parallel reduction** (\\(\log_2(TPB) = 3\\) iterations):

   Only the first 7 threads participate in meaningful computation. After all three iterations:
   ```
   shared = [8, 17, 27, 38, 50, 63, 77, uninitialized]
   ```

3. **Write local results back to global memory**:
   ```
   output[8...14] = [8, 17, 27, 38, 50, 63, 77]  // Only 7 valid outputs
   ```

4. **Store block sum in auxiliary space** (only last thread in block):
   ```
   output[16] = shared[7]  // Thread 7 (TPB-1) stores whatever is in shared[7]
   ```
   Note: Even though Thread 7 doesn't load valid input data, it still participates in the prefix sum computation within the block. The `shared[7]` position gets updated during the parallel reduction iterations, but since it started uninitialized, the final value is unpredictable. However, this doesn't affect correctness because Block 1 is the last block, so this block sum is never used in Phase 2.

After Phase 1, the output buffer contains:
```
[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 8, 17, 27, 38, 50, 63, 77, 28, ???]
                                                        ^   ^
                                                Block sums stored here
```
Note: The last block sum (???) is unpredictable since it's based on uninitialized memory, but this doesn't affect the final result.

## Host-device synchronization: When it's actually needed

The two kernel phases execute sequentially **without any explicit synchronization** between them:

```mojo
# Phase 1: Local prefix sums
ctx.enqueue_function[prefix_sum_local_phase[...]](...)

# Phase 2: Add block sums (automatically waits for Phase 1)
ctx.enqueue_function[prefix_sum_block_sum_phase[...]](...)
```

**Key insight**: Mojo's `DeviceContext` uses a single execution stream (CUDA stream on NVIDIA GPUs, HIP stream on AMD ROCm GPUs), which guarantees that kernel launches execute in the exact order they are enqueued. No explicit synchronization is needed between kernels.

**When `ctx.synchronize()` is needed**:

```mojo
# After both kernels complete, before reading results on host
ctx.synchronize()  # Host waits for GPU to finish

with out.map_to_host() as out_host:  # Now safe to read GPU results
    print("out:", out_host)
```

The `ctx.synchronize()` call serves its traditional purpose:
- **Host-device synchronization**: Ensures the host waits for all GPU work to complete before accessing results
- **Memory safety**: Prevents reading GPU memory before computations finish

**Execution model**: Unlike `barrier()` which synchronizes threads within a block, kernel ordering comes from Mojo's single-stream execution model, while `ctx.synchronize()` handles host-device coordination.

## Phase 2 kernel: Block sum addition

1. **Block 0**: No changes needed (it's already correct).

2. **Block 1**: Each thread adds Block 0's sum to its element:
   ```
   prev_block_sum = output[size + block_idx.x - 1] = output[15] = 28
   output[global_i] += prev_block_sum
   ```

   Block 1 values are transformed:
   ```
   Before: [8, 17, 27, 38, 50, 63, 77]
   After:  [36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105]
   ```

## Performance and optimization considerations

### Key implementation details

**Local phase synchronization pattern**: Each iteration within a block follows a strict read → sync → write pattern:
1. `var current_val: out.element_type = 0` - Initialize local variable
2. `current_val = shared[local_i - offset]` - Read phase (if conditions met)
3. `barrier()` - Explicit synchronization to prevent race conditions
4. `shared[local_i] += current_val` - Write phase (if conditions met)
5. `barrier()` - Standard synchronization before next iteration

**Cross-block synchronization**: The algorithm uses two levels of synchronization:
- **Intra-block**: `barrier()` synchronizes threads within each block during local prefix sum computation
- **Inter-block**: `ctx.synchronize()` synchronizes between kernel launches to ensure Phase 1 completes before Phase 2 begins

**Race condition prevention**: The explicit read-write separation in the local phase prevents the race condition that would occur if threads simultaneously read from and write to the same shared memory locations during parallel reduction.

1. **Work efficiency**: This implementation has \\(O(n \log n)\\) work complexity, while the sequential algorithm is \\(O(n)\\). This is a classic space-time tradeoff in parallel algorithms.

2. **Memory overhead**: The extra space for block sums is minimal (just one element per block).

This two-kernel approach is a fundamental pattern in GPU programming for algorithms that require cross-block communication. The same strategy can be applied to other parallel algorithms like radix sort, histogram calculation, and reduction operations.
